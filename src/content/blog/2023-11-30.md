<p> I created this website so that we could have an embed for our ModDB competition as a gag. But then I
    realized, if I come to this length,
    spent actual money on a domain and time sorting all of this out, why shouldn't I do something
    greater? </p>
<p> Anyway, all of us at the Black Orchestra development team have thought that this was a fun idea, and
    also an opportunity to be more serious in our development.
    We'll see what we can do with this website in the future. Maybe... this place will benefit as a
    development blog. </p>

<p> As a starter, here's the German M40 field coat I made a while ago. Well... I guess that's all I'm
    willing to share. I'm not a blogger. - Hoover </p>
