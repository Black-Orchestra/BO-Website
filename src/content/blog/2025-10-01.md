<h> October 1rd, 2025 </h>
<h> Black Orchestra Team announces the Open Beta! </h>
<p> Hello everyone, </p>
<p> On October 3rd, we will push our Open Beta branch to ModDB. </p>
<p> After all these years, we are eager to show you our passion project. We did have a plan to push for a Steam release, but it would have to wait; there's some bureaucracy bogus working out in the background.
  We said, screw it! No more delays! We can't lead on our starving loyal follower no more. ModDB is our second safest option; while it involves manual installing, this is the most flexible option for everybody. </p>
<p> If you do encounter any issue, please report it to us. We can be easily reached through our Discord, or email at contact@blackorchestra.net. </p>
<p>- Hoover </p>
