# Black Orchestra Team announces the Open Beta!
<p> Hello everyone, </p>
<p> On October 3rd, we will push our Open Beta branch to ModDB. </p>
<p> After all these years, we are eager to show you our passion project. We did have a plan to push for a Steam release, but it would have to wait; there's some bureaucracy bogus working out in the background.
  We said, screw it! No more delays! We can't lead on our starving loyal followers. ModDB is our second safest option; while it involves manual installing, this is the most flexible option for everybody. </p>
<p> But where's the download!? Scroll up and click on the wrench icon </p> 
<p> If you do encounter any issue, please report it to us. We can be easily reached through our Discord, or email at contact@blackorchestra.net. </p>
<p>- Hoover </p>
