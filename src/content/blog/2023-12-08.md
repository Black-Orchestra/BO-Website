<h1> December 8th, 2023 </h1>
<h1> Please welcome our Black Orchestra Map Update! </h1>

<p> All maps set in the Mediterranean theatre of war including several Eastern, Western and Pacific front
    maps are produced by Level Artist/Level Designer North_Dumpling with additional asset assistance from
    FaNgum. </p>

<p> While our maps are based on historical battles they take place in, it is not always a smart decision to
    portray locations in their 1:1 scale as gameplay always comes first for us, so certain liberties are
    made. </p>

<p> Each and every map always requires thoughtful design process starting with blockout and finishing with
    visual polishing. </p>

<p> Our maps are always made based on specific metrics we have set ourselves such as visuals, geomorphology,
    location, factions involved and weapons/vehicles used by the teams. </p>


<p> Everything you see currently is WIP and subject to change. </p>
